## Blackie.

Aka: pudge, poo, blackie el poo, bad cat, smudge, mr b, mr benitez, black bear.

He's 17, deaf, and still a bit mistrustful of humans. He's gentle, sweet old man, tho. He's particular about being touched. **Don't touch ears!**

* First, let him sniff you and rub his pudgy cheeks on your hand.
* All rubs must be gentle.
* He likes gentle rubs from his nose up to the center of his head (no ears though), under his chin, and on his neck and shoulder blades.
* He can bite and scratch, but he is pretty harmless.
* Pick up at your own risk.

## Doobias

Aka: doob, doob tube (he loves his cat tower tube), doobie, fine boi, brad pitt, david duchovny cat.

He's a sweet boi and loves everybody. Pick him up, give him belly rubs...he loves attention.

## FeLV
This a Feline leukemia virus colony. Both boys have survived many years with it but we don't want to spread it. Don't take these cats anywere, and don't let them escape outside. Don't bring other cats. Wash hands after handling just to be safe.

## Food
There is dish on right of sink that has scrubber and spoon. Use these for all cat duties.

Dry food: fill bowls completely
Wet food: 
* clean out bowls
* One vist per day gets a can each OR Two vists per day gets a half can each feeding. They probably won't eat this all.
* Add some hot water to the wet food and mix up a bit please.

Both should come for food, but if Doobie doesn't, pick him up and place him at the food. Blackie lives for wet food, he should eat on his own. If he doesn't please contact me immediately.

Blackie eats on the left, and Doobie on the right.

Water: scrub the bowl and fill to max with cold water.

Treats: doob gets a bunch. Blackie less, and they need to be broken in half.

## Litter Box
It's in the bathroom. Use the grocery bags (I don't have a genie bags) and place in the trash on the balcony. Add a little bit of litter.
**TIP:** Blackie pees on the side of the box which is annoying...try and come from underneath with the scooper and pry it off in one piece :)

## Barf Time!
Check for any barfs on the floor: just some damp paper towel should be fine. If the barf on the bed or anything else, meh.
